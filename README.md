# Note_Taker_challenge_module_11
## Description
Your assignment is to modify starter code to create an application called Note Taker that can be used to write and save notes. This application will use an Express.js back end and will save and retrieve note data from a JSON file.
The application’s front end has already been created. It's your job to build the back end, connect the two, and then deploy the entire application to Heroku.

AS A small business owner
I WANT to be able to write and save notes
SO THAT I can organize my thoughts and keep track of tasks I need to complete

GIVEN a note-taking application
WHEN I open the Note Taker
THEN I am presented with a landing page with a link to a notes page
WHEN I click on the link to the notes page
THEN I am presented with a page with existing notes listed in the left-hand column, plus empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column
WHEN I enter a new note title and the note’s text
THEN a Save icon appears in the navigation at the top of the page
WHEN I click on the Save icon
THEN the new note I have entered is saved and appears in the left-hand column with the other existing notes
WHEN I click on an existing note in the list in the left-hand column
THEN that note appears in the right-hand column
WHEN I click on the Write icon in the navigation at the top of the page
THEN I am presented with empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column

## Installation

This app uses an Express.js back end to save and retrieve note data from a JSON file. Node.js, which is a run-time environment which includes everything you need to execute a program written in JavaScript. If haven't downloaded the Node.js source code or a pre-built installer for your platform, you will need to do so using this link.

The dependencies required for this project are:

Express is the most widely used Node.js server framework, this allows us to create our own server-side APIs.
